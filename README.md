# Project Coeus: The Unified Metric Stiffening Framework (V.1.0)

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.18641401.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18641401)

This repository contains the definitive field equations, theoretical derivations, and numerical implementations for **Impedance Phase Persistence (IPP)** and the **Law of Unified Mechanical Expansion (Network G)**.

## 🌌 Executive Summary
Project Coeus identifies "Dark Matter" and "Dark Energy" anomalies not as missing particles, but as emergent properties of a **Dynamic Active Vacuum**. By anchoring gravitational response and information velocity to local energy density and the expansion scalar, we resolve core crises in modern cosmology (Hubble Tension, Genzel Paradox) through a **Horndeski-class Covariant Field Theory**.

## 🏎️ The Four Pillars of Network G
The framework operates as an **Active Handling System** for spacetime, governed by four mechanical principles:

1. **Energy Density (The Mechanical State):** Vacuum "stiffening" governed by the **Navarro-Fine Structure Identity** ($\alpha_0 \approx 0.06113$).
2. **Expansion Damping (The Environmental Weather):** Rapid expansion acts as a "storm" that prevents vacuum grip, resolving the **Genzel Paradox**.
3. **Network Neighbor Influence (The Traffic Flow):** Geodesic Interlocking between adjacent masses (Resolving outliers like **NGC 2841**).
4. **Outside-In Resolution (The Racing Line):** Boundary conditions at galactic radii dictate internal kinematics ($R^2 = 0.9563$).

## 🛠️ Key Breakthroughs

### 1. Galactic Dynamics (The MagneRide Vacuum)
Replaces Dark Matter halos with a diffeomorphism-invariant metric response (Disformal Transformation).
* **Verified Performance:** $R^2 = 0.9563$ (SPARC High-Ground Sample).
* **Precision:** $\pm 18.21$ km/s RMSE across diverse morphologies.
* **The Shatter Wall:** Identifies a physical limit to vacuum stiffening, matching the **Bullet Cluster** offset.



### 2. Cosmological Evolution (The Odometer Paradox)
Resolves the **Hubble Tension** and **JWST "Impossible" Galaxy Paradox**.
* **Metric Impedance:** Explains the discrepancy between Planck (CMB) and SH0ES (Local) measurements via a variable velocity of information governed by the expansion scalar $\theta$.
* **Horndeski-class Action:** A formal scalar-tensor implementation that ensures general covariance and energy-momentum conservation.

## 🧪 Experimental Proposals
The framework provides falsifiable targets for:
* **High-Redshift Damping:** Gravitational Wave-Photon time lags at ($z \gtrsim 2$).
* **Local Saturated Phase:** Precision frequency shifts in Trans-Neptunian clock synchronization.
* **The Shatter Limit:** Mapping the geometric "Bump Stop" in high-velocity cluster collisions.
