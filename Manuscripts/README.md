# Project Coeus: The Unified Metric Stiffening Framework V.1.0

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.18641401.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18641401)

This directory contains the definitive field equations, theoretical derivations, and narrative summaries for **Kinetic-Gravity Coupling (KGC)** and the **Law of Unified Mechanical Expansion (Network G)**.

## 🌌 Executive Summary
Project Coeus identifies "Dark Matter" and "Dark Energy" anomalies not as missing particles, but as emergent properties of a **Dynamic Active Vacuum**. By anchoring gravitational response and information velocity to local energy density and the expansion scalar, we resolve the core crises in modern cosmology through the lens of **Vacuum Engineering**.

## 🏎️ The Four Pillars of Network G
The framework operates as an **Active Handling System** for spacetime, governed by four mechanical principles:

1. **Energy Density (The Mechanical State):** Vacuum "stiffening" (Phase Change) based on local matter concentration.
2. **Expansion Damping (The Environmental Weather):** Rapid expansion acts as a "storm" that prevents vacuum grip, explaining the **Genzel Paradox**.
3. **Network Neighbor Influence (The Traffic Flow):** Geodesic Interlocking between adjacent masses (Resolving outliers like **NGC 2841**).
4. **Outside-In Resolution (The Racing Line):** Boundary conditions at the galactic radii dictate internal kinematics ($R^2 = 0.9561$).

## 🛠️ Key Breakthroughs

### 1. Galactic Dynamics (The MagneRide Vacuum)
Replaces Dark Matter halos with a diffeomorphism-invariant metric response.
* **Verified Performance:** $R^2 = 0.9561$ (SPARC High-Ground Sample).
* **Precision:** $\pm 18.25$ km/s RMSE across diverse morphologies.
* **The Shatter Wall:** Identifies a physical "Bump Stop" limit to vacuum stiffening, geometrically matching the **Bullet Cluster** offset.



### 2. Cosmological Evolution (The Odometer Paradox)
Resolves the **Hubble Tension** and **JWST "Impossible" Galaxy Paradox**.
* **The Paving Machine Logic:** High expansion rates in the early universe acted as a high-speed construction phase. Massive galaxies formed faster because the "machine" was running at a higher rate; we misinterpret their age today because our "odometer" is calibrated to the modern, slower expansion rate.
* **Metric Impedance:** Explains the 9% discrepancy between Planck (CMB) and SH0ES (Local) measurements via a variable velocity of information.

## 🧪 Experimental Proposals
The framework provides falsifiable targets for:
* **High-Redshift Damping:** Gravitational Wave-Photon time lags at ($z \gtrsim 2$).
* **Local Saturated Phase:** Precision frequency shifts in Trans-Neptunian clock synchronization.
* **The Shatter Limit:** Mapping the geometric "Bump Stop" in high-velocity cluster collisions.
