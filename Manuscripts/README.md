The Law of Unified Mechanical Expansion (LUME) & Kinetic-Gravity Coupling (KGC)

This repository formalizes the transition from "Dark" variables to a Dynamic Metric Architecture. By identifying the scaling relationship between the expansion rate (H) and the fundamental constants (G and c), we provide a mechanical resolution to the Hubble Tension, the Genzel Paradox, and the maturity of high-redshift galaxies.
