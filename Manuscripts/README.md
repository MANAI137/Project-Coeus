# Project Coeus: The Unified Metric Stiffening Framework

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.18641401.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18641401)

This repository contains the definitive field equations and statistical validation for **Kinetic-Gravity Coupling (KGC)** and the **Law of Unified Mechanical Expansion (LUME)**.

## Executive Summary
Project Coeus identifies the "Missing Mass" (Dark Matter) and "Missing Energy" (Dark Energy) anomalies as emergent properties of a dynamical spacetime metric. By anchoring gravitational response and information velocity to the local expansion scalar $\theta$, we resolve the core crises in modern cosmology without the need for undetected particles.

### Key Breakthroughs
* **Galactic Dynamics (KGC):** Replaces Dark Matter halos with a diffeomorphism-invariant metric response.
  * **Verified Performance:** $R^2 = 0.9586$ (SPARC High-Ground Sample).
  * **Core Identity:** $\gamma = -0.0605$ governs the "Plateau-Lock" of spiral galaxies.
* **Cosmological Evolution (LUME):** Resolves the **Hubble Tension** and **JWST Maturity Paradox**.
  * **Mechanism:** A disformal photon metric $\hat{g}^{(\gamma)}_{\mu\nu}$ creates a variable velocity of information $c(\theta)$.
  * **Metric Impedance:** Explains the 9% discrepancy between Planck (CMB) and SH0ES (Local) measurements.

## Experimental Proposals
The framework provides falsifiable targets for:
- High-redshift Gravitational Wave-Photon time lags ($z \gtrsim 2$).
- Lyman-$\alpha$ forest effective optical-depth rescaling.
- Trans-Neptunian precision clock frequency shifts.
